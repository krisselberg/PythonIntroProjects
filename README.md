# Python Introductory Projects #
This repository contains all of my introductory projects that I took on while first learning Python.

### [Tic Tac Toe in the Command Line](https://github.com/krisselberg/PythonIntroProjects/blob/main/PythonPractice/tictactoe.py "tictactoe.py") ###

This was my first project ever in Python, and I learned the basic syntax of conditional statements, functions, and how to take input from the command line.

### [Automated Pomodoro Technique](https://github.com/krisselberg/PythonIntroProjects/blob/main/PythonPractice/pomodoro.py "pomodoro.py") ###

Automated one of my study techniques that I use every day to take small breaks through long periods of work. I learned how to use the os and time modules to set up a system in which my computer notifies me through voice notifications. (Must import sox through MacPorts using sudo port install sox on OS)
